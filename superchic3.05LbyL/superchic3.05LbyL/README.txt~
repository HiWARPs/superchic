Compiles/runs as in manual in doc/ folder, but new additions wrt LbyL *not* described there. The new inputs for this are provided at the bottom of the input files - I have set up these for the run2 and run3 kinematics described in the overleaf (additional cuts on e.g. acoplanarity not included). 

The actual implementation of the various LbyL amplitudes is in 'src/subamps/lightlightpol.f'
